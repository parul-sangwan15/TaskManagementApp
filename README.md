## Goal
The goal of this Java application is to provide a simple task management system with basic functionalities such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing components, allowing users to interact with tasks in a visually intuitive way.

## Implementation
The application is implemented using Java programming language and utilizes the following components:
- **Swing Framework**: Java's Swing framework is used to create the graphical user interface, including buttons, text fields, and lists.
- **Event Handling**: Event listeners are employed to handle user interactions such as mouse clicks and button presses.
- **Task Class**: A custom `Task` class is defined to represent individual tasks, containing attributes such as title and completion status.
- **List Model**: A `DefaultListModel` is used to manage the list of tasks displayed in the GUI.
- **JFrame**: The `TaskManagement` class extends `JFrame` to create the main application window.

Achieved Insights
- **Graphical User Interface**: By leveraging Java's Swing framework, the application provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, enhancing user experience and usability.
- **Event Handling**: Through event handling mechanisms, the application responds to user interactions in real-time, ensuring smooth and intuitive task management.
- **Task Management Logic**: The implementation of task management logic, including functionalities like adding, editing, and deleting tasks, demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as object-oriented design and data manipulation.
